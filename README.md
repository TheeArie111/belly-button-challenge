# Belly Button Biodiversity

# Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Plotly Steps

1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.
```python
const url = 'https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json';
const dataPromise = d3.json(url); 
console.log('Data Promise: ', dataPromise); 
```

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

* Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

* Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

* Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

* Use `sample_values` for the y values.

* Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

* Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

* Use `otu_labels` for the text values.

4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
